###### Duplicate of the text on the website :
Common Graphs Composer offers online software wich allows you to create basics graphics, like timelines. This product is 100% free, and you are not the product because of no ads and no data storing.

#### No data storing ? But where is stored my timeline ?
Your work is stored directly in your computer, using your browser local storage. This website does not have any server-side code. If you wants to share a graphic or to store it securely, you can download it as a .json file.

# Technical information
